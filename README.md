# Simple Python Calculator
This is a simple command-line calculator written in Python. It supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The project is designed to be easy to use and understand for both beginners and intermediate Python developers.

## Features
・Addition: Adds two numbers.
・Subtraction: Subtracts one number from another.
・Multiplication: Multiplies two numbers.
・Division: Divides one number by another (with handling for division by zero).
・Error Handling: Catches invalid input and prints error messages.

## Prerequisites
Python 3.x or higher should be installed on your machine.
Installation
1.Clone the Repository:
bash-> git clone https://github.com/your-username/calculator-python.git
cd calculator-python
2.No Additional Dependencies: This project doesn't require any external Python libraries or dependencies. It only uses built-in Python functions.

## Usage
1.Run the Calculator
To run the calculator, open your terminal, navigate to the project directory, and execute the Python script:
bash-> python calculator.py
Available Operations
2.The calculator will prompt you to enter two numbers and then choose an operation. Here are the available options:
  1: Addition (+)
  2: Subtraction (-)
  3: Multiplication (*)
  4: Division (/)
3.Example of Use Case
bash-> $ python calculator.py
Enter first number: 25
Enter second number: 5
Choose operation (+, -, *, /): /
Result: 5.0
If you try an invalid input, the calculator will show an error message and prompt for valid input.
4.Error Handling
If you try to divide by zero, the calculator will display an appropriate error message.

Example:
python-> Division by zero is not allowed!
If you provide an invalid input (e.g., a letter instead of a number), the calculator will ask you to enter valid numbers.

## Code Structure
The project consists of a single Python file (calculator.py) with the following structure:
・Input Handling: Accepts user input for numbers and operations.
・Operations Functions: Functions to perform the addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
・Error Handling: Ensures safe and valid calculations by catching invalid inputs and division by zero.
